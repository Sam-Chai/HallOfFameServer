Server part of the [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/toverux/HallOfFame) mod for Cities: Skylines II.

## Development

### Installation

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh).
2. (Recommended) Install [Volta](https://volta.sh) for per-project Node.js version management,
   or use Node >= 22. Node is still needed to run the bundlers, while Bun is used for package
   management and the server runtime.
3. Run `bun i` to install dependencies.
4. You may `bun run build` to test that the project builds and everything is in order.

### Development Workflow

TBD

### Updating Dependencies & Toolchain

- To update Bun: `bun upgrade`, and update `package.json#packageManager`.
- To update Node: `volta install node@latest`, and update `package.json#engines.node`.
- To update npm dependencies: `bun check-updates`.

## Code Style

### TypeScript

TypeScript code is formatted and linted by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
Run `bun run check` to check for linting errors, format files and autofix simple issues.

You can also use Biome directly with `bun biome`.

The formatter and linter should run as a pre-commit hook if you have it installed,
which should be done automatically when running `bun i` (otherwise run `bun lefthook install`).

I'd suggest to use a Biome plugin for your editor to ease development.

If a rule seems out of place for this project, you can either disable/reconfigure
it in the `biome.json` file or disable it with an annotation comment, but these
should be justified and concerted.

### Commit messages

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
specification and more specifically the Angular one.

Scope can be one or more of the following:
- `server`: for non-specific changes in the server;
- `admin`: for changes in the backoffice admin interface;
- `api`: for changes in the server HTTP API;
- `i18n`: for changes in translations and translations system;
- `deps`: for dependencies updates;
- Propose new scopes if needed!
