## Development

### Installation

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh).
2. Run `bun i` to install dependencies.
3. You may `bun run build` to test that the project builds and everything is in order.

### Development workflow

TBD

## Code Style

### TypeScript

TypeScript code is formatted and linted by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
Run `bun run check` to check for linting errors, format files and autofix simple issues.

You can also use Biome directly with `bun biome`.

The formatter and linter should run as a pre-commit hook if you have it installed,
which should be done automatically when running `bun i` (otherwise run `bun lefthook install`).

I'd suggest to use a Biome plugin for your editor to ease development.

If a rule seems out of place for this project, you can either disable/reconfigure
it in the `biome.json` file or disable it with an annotation comment, but these
should be justified and concerted.

### Commit messages

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
specification and more specifically the Angular one.

Scope can be one or more of the following:
- `api`: for changes in the server HTTP API;
- `i18n`: for changes in translations and translations system;
- `deps`: for dependencies updates;
- Propose new scopes if needed!
